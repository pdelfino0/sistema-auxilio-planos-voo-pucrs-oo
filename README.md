# Sistema de Auxílio para Planos de Voo (Projeto Acadêmico da PUCRS)

Welcome to the Flight Plan Assistance System! This project is a part of the Analysis and Systems Development course at PUCRS (Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul). Our primary goal is to create a JavaScript-based system that aids pilots in creating flight plans. This project is divided into two phases and is based on the object-oriented concepts learned during the course.

⚠️ **Important Note:** Flight Plan Assistance System is a university project designed for educational purposes. It is not intended for real-world flight planning or navigation. Please do not use it for scheduling actual flight plans.

## Phase 1 - Modeling and Implementation of Core Classes

In this initial phase, we have developed essential classes, including `Piloto`, `Serviço de Pilotos`, a hierarchy of aircraft classes, `Serviço de Aeronaves`, `Aerovia`, and `Serviço de Aerovias`. We've also created a UML class diagram to represent the system's structure.

## Phase 2 - Implementation of the Complete System

The second phase focuses on completing the system, including a text-mode interface with a menu offering all the necessary functionalities. We will employ software testing to validate the system's business rules. The modeling will adhere to the Object-Oriented paradigm.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Flight Plan Assistance System, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.

## Usage

Once the system is running, you can interact with it through the text-based menu. Follow the on-screen prompts to create and manage flight plans.
